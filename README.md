# Population Data Analysis

- This project analyzes population data from various countries over different years. The data is sourced from CSV files and includes information on population, median age, and births per woman.
- Developed a data-driven predictive model to analyze global population trends, incorporating fertility rate, median age, and life expectancy as key variables.
- Optimized population forecasting by evaluating multiple regression techniques (LARS, Lasso, Ridge) and selecting the most accurate model with minimal error metrics.
- Conducted extensive data cleaning, EDA, and visualization, uncovering key insights like declining fertility rates and demographic shifts, aiding long-term policy recommendations.
